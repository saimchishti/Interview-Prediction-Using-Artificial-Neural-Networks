# Predicting Job Eligibility of Salesman Applicants Using Deep Neural Networks

This repository contains a project aimed at predicting job eligibility for salesman applicants using a **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**. The dataset used includes interview responses and various metrics such as confidence, structured thinking, and fluency. The project showcases data preprocessing, feature reduction, model training, and deployment.

## Features
- **Dataset:** Kaggle dataset containing applicant data.
- **Deep Neural Network:** Predicts applicant eligibility with a test accuracy of **79.5%**.
- **Feature Reduction:** Dimensionality reduction from 52 features to 18 using JMAF software.
- **Frontend Interface:** Predicts applicant eligibility based on input features (to be added).

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values (numerical columns filled with medians).
- Encode categorical data using label encoding.
- Scale numerical data with StandardScaler.
- Apply feature reduction using JMAF software, reducing features from 52 to 18.

### 2. Deep Neural Network Architecture
- **Input Layer:** 18 neurons (one for each feature).
- **Hidden Layers:**
  - Layer 1: 128 neurons, ReLU activation, 30% dropout.
  - Layer 2: 64 neurons, ReLU activation, 30% dropout.
  - Layer 3: 32 neurons, ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer:** 1 neuron, Sigmoid activation (binary classification).

### 3. Model Configuration
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Binary Cross-Entropy
- **Learning Rate:** 0.001
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Batch Size:** 16

### 4. Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy:** 79.5% on test data.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Evaluates model predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score:** Additional evaluation metrics.
